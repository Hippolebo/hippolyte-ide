## 🎯 Investment Thesis

**The Bull Case:**
Market is too pessimistic on these stocks. With average P/E of 6.61 and yield of 5.47%, even modest earnings stability could deliver strong total returns. Several quality businesses (Campine, Proximus, Shurgard) are trading at irrational discounts.

**The Bear Case:**
Low P/Es exist for good reasons - deteriorating fundamentals, small cap illiquidity, high leverage, and sector concentration. Forward P/E expansion across multiple holdings suggests earnings headwinds. This is a value trap portfolio.

**My Take:**
**Proceed with caution.** This is a high-risk, high-potential-return portfolio. Cherry-picking 3-4 of the highest quality names (Campine, Proximus, Shurgard, Gimv) might be smarter than blindly buying all 10. The equal-weighted approach captures the strategy but doesn't distinguish between quality value and value traps.

## 📊 Next Steps

1. **Track performance** quarterly vs. BEL 20 Index
2. **Monitor for dividend cuts** (especially high payout stocks)
3. **Rebalance quarterly** - replace stocks that no longer meet criteria
4. **Compare to other countries** as analysis expands
